# Medical Triage & Discharge Planning Environment

A reinforcement learning environment for training AI agents to perform clinical triage and discharge planning tasks. Built with OpenEnv for the Meta PyTorch Hackathon 2026.

## Overview

This environment simulates an emergency department workflow where an AI agent acts as a triage nurse and discharge coordinator. The agent must prioritize patients, order appropriate diagnostic tests, and make safe discharge decisions under time and resource constraints.

**Why this matters:** Clinical decision support is a $5B+ industry, and this environment provides a standardized way to evaluate medical reasoning capabilities in large language models.

## Tasks

The environment includes three progressive tasks of increasing difficulty:

### Task 1: Triage Prioritization (Easy)
**Goal:** Assign urgency levels to incoming patients based on symptoms and vital signs.

- **Input:** Patient case with symptoms, vitals, history
- **Output:** Urgency level (1=Immediate, 2=Urgent, 3=Non-urgent)
- **Grading:**
  - Exact match: **1.0** (e.g., correct answer is 2, agent assigns 2)
  - One level off: **0.5** (e.g., correct answer is 2, agent assigns 1 or 3)
  - Two levels off: **0.0** (e.g., correct answer is 1, agent assigns 3 - calling a critical patient "non-urgent")

### Task 2: Investigation Ordering (Medium)
**Goal:** Select appropriate diagnostic tests while avoiding over-testing.

- **Input:** Triaged patient needing workup
- **Output:** List of investigation codes (e.g., ["ecg", "troponin", "cbc"])
- **Grading:** F1 score based on precision/recall, -0.1 penalty per unnecessary test

### Task 3: Full Discharge Decision (Hard)
**Goal:** Provide complete discharge plan with diagnosis, medications, and disposition.

- **Input:** Patient with complete clinical picture
- **Output:** Diagnosis, admit/discharge decision, medications, follow-up timeline
- **Grading:** Weighted scoring (30% diagnosis + 30% disposition + 20% medications + 20% follow-up) with **-0.5 safety penalty** for discharging critical patients

## Environment Details

### Patient Cases
30 synthetic patient cases spanning three urgency tiers:
- **10 Immediate (P001-P010):** MI, pulmonary edema, stroke, anaphylaxis, etc.
- **10 Urgent (P011-P020):** Appendicitis, pneumonia, fractures, etc.
- **10 Non-urgent (P021-P030):** Pharyngitis, sprains, UTIs, etc.

Each case includes:
- Demographics (age, sex)
- Chief complaint
- Vital signs (HR, BP, SpO2, temp, RR)
- Medical history and current medications
- Ground truth: diagnosis, required tests, safe medications, correct disposition

### Available Investigations
22 diagnostic tests including:
- Cardiac: ECG, troponin, BNP
- Imaging: CXR, CT head/abdomen, ultrasound
- Labs: CBC, electrolytes, lactate, blood glucose
- Specialized: Lumbar puncture, endoscopy, compartment pressure

### Reward Structure
**Partial credit** at each decision point:
- Correct urgency assignment: +0.3 to +1.0
- Appropriate test ordering: F1 score - over-testing penalty
- Accurate diagnosis: +0.15 to +0.3
- Safe disposition: +0.3 (or -0.5 if unsafe)
- Appropriate medications: +0.2
- Follow-up planning: +0.2

**Safety-first design:** Discharging a patient with urgency=1 (life-threatening) incurs a -0.5 penalty, ensuring the agent learns to prioritize patient safety.
##  Detailed Scoring Guide
### Task 1: Triage Prioritization (Easy)

**Task:** Assign one of **3 urgency levels** (1=Immediate, 2=Urgent, 3=Non-urgent)

**Scoring:**
- Exact urgency match: **1.0**
- Off by 1 level: **0.5**
- Off by 2 levels: **0.0**

**Possible scores:** Only **0.0, 0.5, or 1.0** (no other values)

**Example:**
- Correct urgency: 2 (Urgent)
- Agent assigns 2 → **1.0**  (perfect match)
- Agent assigns 1 or 3 → **0.5** (off by 1 level)
- Agent assigns the opposite extreme → **0.0** (off by 2 levels - dangerous)

---

### Task 2: Investigation Ordering (Medium)

**Formula:** `F1 Score - (0.1 × number_of_unnecessary_tests)`

**Components:**
- **Precision:** How many ordered tests were actually needed?
- **Recall:** How many required tests were ordered?
- **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Penalty:** -0.1 per unnecessary test (encourages cost-conscious ordering)

**Score Interpretation:**
- **0.8-1.0:** Excellent - ordered right tests, minimal waste
- **0.5-0.7:** Good - got most tests, some over/under-testing
- **0.2-0.4:** Poor - missed critical tests or severe over-testing
- **0.0-0.1:** Failed - wrong workup entirely

**Example:**
- Required: `["ct_abdomen", "cbc", "lactate"]`
- Agent orders: `["cbc", "urinalysis", "lactate", "electrolytes"]`
- True positives: 2 (cbc, lactate)
- Precision: 2/4 = 0.5, Recall: 2/3 = 0.67
- F1: 0.571, Penalty: -0.2 (2 unnecessary tests)
- **Final: 0.371**

---

### Task 3: Full Discharge Decision (Hard)

**Formula:** 
```
0.3 × diagnosis_match + 
0.3 × disposition_match + 
0.2 × medication_match + 
0.2 × followup_match - 
safety_penalty
```

**Component Scoring:**
- **Diagnosis:** 1.0 if matches ground truth, 0.0 otherwise
- **Disposition:** 1.0 if admit/discharge correct, 0.0 otherwise
- **Medications:** Proportion of correct meds (e.g., 2/3 = 0.67)
- **Follow-up:** 1.0 if within acceptable range, 0.0 otherwise
- **Safety Penalty:** -0.5 if discharging a critical patient (urgency=1)

**Score Interpretation:**
- **0.8-1.0:** Excellent - correct diagnosis, safe disposition, appropriate care
- **0.5-0.7:** Good - mostly correct with minor medication/follow-up issues
- **0.3-0.4:** Fair - got some components right but major gaps
- **0.0-0.2:** Poor/Unsafe - wrong diagnosis or unsafe discharge

**Example:**
- Patient: Anaphylaxis (urgency=1)
- Agent: diagnosis="Anaphylaxis" , disposition="admit" , meds=["epinephrine", "antihistamine"] 
- Score: 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.2 + partial followup = **0.667**


##  Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the environment
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/ishakhatana17/medical-triage-env
cd medical-triage-env

# Install dependencies
pip install -r server/requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage
```python
import asyncio
from client import MedicalTriageEnv
from models import TriageAction

async def main():
    async with MedicalTriageEnv(base_url="https://ishakhatana17-medical-triage-env.hf.space") as env:
        # Reset environment
        result = await env.reset()
        print(result.observation.task_instruction)
        
        # Easy task: Triage prioritization
        action = TriageAction(
            task_type="easy",
            urgency_assignment=2  # Urgent
        )
        result = await env.step(action)
        print(f"Reward: {result.reward}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Running the Server Locally
```bash
# Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn server.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Or use Docker
docker build -t medical-triage:latest -f server/Dockerfile .
docker run -p 8000:8000 medical-triage:latest
```

### Running Inference
```bash
# Set environment variables
export API_BASE_URL="https://router.huggingface.co/v1"
export MODEL_NAME="Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct"
export HF_TOKEN="your_token_here"

# Run baseline inference
python inference.py
```

## 📈 Baseline Performance

Running `inference.py` with Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct achieves:

| Task | Score Range | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Easy | 0.0 - 1.0 | Varies based on random patient selection |
| Medium | 0.0 - 0.8 | LLM orders appropriate tests for different patient presentations |
| Hard | 0.0 - 0.4 | Multi-component scoring with safety penalties |

**Sample run:**
```
Easy:   0.500
Medium: 0.757  
Hard:   0.300
```

The score variance demonstrates that graders respond dynamically to different inputs and agent decisions.
